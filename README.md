# Distributed V-JEPA: Enabling Intelligent Distributed Sensing through Self-Supervised Cross-Device Knowledge Sharing

![Demo Reconstruction](assets/reconstruction.gif)

## Overview

**Distributed V-JEPA (DV-JEPA)** is a self-supervised learning framework designed for distributed sensing systems. By fusing latent embeddings from multiple sub-views, DV-JEPA reconstructs global scenes with high semantic fidelity.

This repository provides:
- Pretrained models for the DV-JEPA pipeline.
- Scripts for training, evaluation, and inference.
- A demo notebook showcasing the reconstruction of full-view videos.
